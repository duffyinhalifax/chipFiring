# chipFiring

Chip Firing is a discrete time process on a graph in which each vertex begins with some initial number of chips. Vertices then send chips to neighbours with fewer vertices (fire) according to some update scheme.

This code provides functionality to run the process where each vertex updates simultaneously.
